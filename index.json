Prior to it, I received the B.Eng. and M.S.E. degrees in Aerospace Engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 2015 and 2017, respectively.\nMy research interest broadly centers around robotics, mainly focusing on motion planning and control synthesis for multi-robot systems under high-level tasks specified by temporal logic formulas. The goal is to design correct-by-construction algorithms with optimality or scalability properties to tackle more complex tasks than conventional point-to-point navigation. In addition, I conducted projects related to human-robot interaction and formal verification of neural network controllers.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://XushengLuo.github.io/author/xusheng-luo/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/xusheng-luo/","section":"authors","summary":"I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Material Sciences, Duke University, under the supervision of Dr. Michael M.
